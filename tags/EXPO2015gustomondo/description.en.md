Whatâ€™s the **taste** of your **world**? This week YourExpo2015 wants to know your world, made of hidden spots, traditional dishes, romantic escapes and old flavors!

* Show what Flavor and World mean to you, according to your personal interpretation.
* Share artistic, communicative, creative and colorful pictures. Share memories of friendship, traditions, trips, and locations from all over the world.
* Take pictures of people, food and situations, little corners of paradise, from the places you used to play when you were a child to your new downtown house, from countryside picnic to romantic dinners, from flea markets and street food to your favorite flavors, from your ambitious trips to the taste of home you feel with your dear ones.
* There is a great story behind each picture, share yours!
