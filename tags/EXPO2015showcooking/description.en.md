* From international chefs to moms preparing dinner, from pizza guys to food carts, from starred cooks of the Michelin guide to granmas baking their cakes
* From nouvelle cousine to take away sushi, from local dishes to continental breakfast, from crepes to pizza, from fast to slow food
* Share pictures of everyday cooking or spectacular food design. Shoot cooks, kitchens and wonderful grand platters
* Capture shows and exhibitions, local fairs and camp kitchens, brillant recipes and foods everyone would be craving for
